# Brain-Tumor-prediction-CNN-
A deep learning project for classifying brain tumor images into four categories — glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor — using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras. The model achieves high accuracy in medical image classification, aiding early diagnosis and treatment.
